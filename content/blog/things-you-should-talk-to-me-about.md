title: Things you should talk to me about

Seems useful to explicitly list things I would love for you, the reader, to share with me.

1. Corrections, alternate perspectives, relevant articles, or anything that can help me form a more accurate mental model of the world than what you see on this blog
2. Immersive theater - shows I should see (digital or New York area), or opportunities to be involved with productions
3. Potential romantic partners - women
4. Ways I might be able to help you
5. Things you have done that caused a stepwise change in your energy/endurance, which isn't the standard advice like "eat well, sleep more"
6. Invitations to hang out, or introductions to friends, in New York - I moved very recently and am trying to build my social network here
7. TMJ experiences - in May 2025 my jaw got weird kinda out of nowhere (maybe from wearing a night mouthguard temporarily) and has bothered me ever since. Very mild but would love to go back to normal
8. (Placeholder item for "anything else" because putting a *finite* list of "things you should talk to me about" feels weird and limiting)
