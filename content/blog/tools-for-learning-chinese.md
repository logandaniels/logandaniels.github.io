Learning characters:
1. [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net) - the classic Spaced Repetition flashcard software. It has the fanciest algorithm, and tons of high quality [shared decks](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1466478713) , including audio.
2. [HanziHero](https://hanzihero.com) - wacky but effective visual [mnemonic system](https://hanzihero.com/traditional/characters/花) for remembering the meanings and sounds of characters
	1. For context on how to use this system, read about [the Marilyn Method](http://countryoftheblind.blogspot.com/2012/01/mnemonics-for-pronouncing-chinese.html)
3. [rtega.be](https://rtega.be/chmn/?c=待) and [Hanzi Yuan](https://hanziyuan.net) -- for an alternate source of character mnemonic / etymology

Dictionary:
1. On iOS, you just need [Pleco](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pleco-chinese-dictionary/id341922306)
2. Pleco is coming soon to Mac at time of writing. But until then, install [CC-EDICT](https://simonwiles.net/projects/cc-cedict/) into Dictionary.app and use the native Mac dictionary
3. [Yabla](https://chinese.yabla.com/chinese-english-pinyin-dictionary.php?define=現代) - it's a dictionary, but more importantly it gives a bunch of real-life example sentences, which you can even click into to watch them spoken on video

Textbook:
1. For simplified characters, the [HSK textbooks and workbooks](https://www.amazon.com/HSK-Standard-Course-SET-Textbook/dp/B07PRPG8QV) ($) are great
2. For traditional characters and Taiwan-specific vocabulary, [A Course in Contemporary Chinese](https://mtc.ntnu.edu.tw/eng/book/A_Course_in_Contemporary_Chinese.html)  ($) is pretty good

Grammar: 
1. [Allset Learning Chinese Grammar Wiki](https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/)

Listening:
1. You can download accompanying audios for the textbook and workbook for either the HSK series or A Course in Contemporary Chinese

Speaking:
1. [iTalki](https://www.italki.com/) ($) this is a great source of native speakers and language teachers to have conversations with, at relatively affordable prices

Reading:
1. [Duchinese](https://duchinese.net) ($) - an extensive library of graded readers for different levels, where each text also has accompanying audio from a native speaker

Other tools:
1. Enable [Trackpad handwriting](https://support.apple.com/guide/chinese-input-method/use-trackpad-handwriting-scim27935/mac) for characters on Mac. Useful for looking up characters you have only seen visually, or for occasional handwriting practice
2. Use [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com) on Mac (or comparable software) to set up quick- search shortcuts to easily pull up the one of the many web tools listed above for a given character
3. [Claude](https://claude.ai) or another AI - great for getting quick feedback like "Is this an appropriate way to say 'If he is cooking dinner then I will leave early' in Chinese? <insert your attempted phrasing\>"
4. [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com) - check if your attempted Chinese phrasing is accurate by seeing if if it translates to English the way you expect

I tried but stopped using:
1. [Remembering the Hanzi](https://www.amazon.com/Remembering-Simplified-Hanzi-Meaning-Characters/dp/0824833236) book by James Heisig - the mnemonics are top-notch, but it's a waste of time to learn character meaning without learning their sounds too. Use HanziHero instead
2. [Learning Chinese Characters](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=learning+chinese+chraters+tutttle&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8) book - I thought the Giant/Fairy/Teddy/Dwarf system for tone mnemonics was weird
3. [Mandarin Companion]([Remembering the Hanzi]) - these are fine graded readers, but you get much more bang for your buck with Duchinese
4. Reading random internet comment threads or watching videos - this is time you can spend learning instead
