Consider the common word "polarize". To polarize is [defined](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/polarize) as “to break up into opposing factions or groupings.”

I recently learned a similar word: “balkanize". To balkanize is [defined](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/balkanized) as  “to divide (a region or body) into smaller mutually hostile states or groups.” What a lovely word! It has an educational etymology as well. 

If not exact synonyms, polarize and balkanize are clearly about as related as two words can possibly be.

Yet if I look up polarize in the thesaurus (i.e., if I google "synonyms for polarize"):
* Webster's thesaurus for some reason [only provides](https://www.merriam-webster.com/thesaurus/polarize) an entry for the alternative, antonymic usage of polarize (its polar opposite, one might say), listing "consolidate" and "unite" but certainly not "balkanize".
* Thesaurus.com [does provide synonyms](https://www.thesaurus.com/browse/polarize) for our desired definition of polarize, though I'll note that the other definitions are useful too, and in a parallel universe I'm complaining about this outcome instead. But it gives a paltry set of alternatives,  like "separate" and "demarcate" -- *none of the provided synonyms* have the same connotation of separation into *opposing* groups.
* [vocabulary.com](https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/polarize) and [synonym.com](https://www.synonym.com/synonyms/polarize) are both no better than thesaurus.com -- apparently once you get a good domain you become complacent)
* The [Cambridge dictionary website](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/thesaurus/polarize) is equally bare, despite its prestigious namesake.

I found the best results on [wordhippo.com](https://www.wordhippo.com/what-is/another-word-for/polarize.html) and [powerthesaurus.org](https://www.powerthesaurus.org/polarize/synonyms). Both contain a fairly extensive list of synonyms, including [factionalize](https://www.wordhippo.com/what-is/another-word-for/factionalize.html), which I think is an excellent synonym for polarize and which I'd actually consider replacing a usage of polarize with, which I can't say of *any* of the definitions in the other thesauruses.

Yet still *none* of these listed balkanize as a synonym. This is despite nearly all of them containing a definitions for balkanize. They have all the pieces, yet fail to connect the dots.

I wish this were an isolated example. Sadly, I consistently find the major online[^1] thesauruses (with the possible exception of new challenger Word Hippo!) meager and uninspiring.

If I didn't independently learn of the word balkanize, I simply would never have discovered it.

How many other linguistic discoveries are being suppressed? How much richer might our vocabularies be with access to a thesaurus that actually does its job? 

There is hope, though. Here's Claude AI's attempt:

> Query: Give an exhaustive list of synonyms for "polarize" (the definition meaning "to break up into opposing factions or groupings")
>
>Claude: Here's an exhaustive list of synonyms for "polarize" in the sense of breaking up into opposing factions or groupings:  
>1. Divide
>2. Split
>3. Separate
>4. Fragment
>5. Factionate
>6. Bifurcate
>7. Cleave
>8. Partition
>9. Segregate
>10. Dichotomize
>11. **Balkanize**
>12. Factionalize
>13. Schism
>14. Rupture
>15. Fracture
>16. Sunder

>22. Drive apart
>23. Create a rift
>24. Cause discord
>25. Sow division
>26. Create factions
>27. Pit against each other
>28. Create a wedge between 

Well done, Claude. I could easily adapt the query to include a definition or explanation of connotations for each word as well.

If we can't count on Webster or Cambridge to provide a compelling thesaurus in 2024, then AI will suffice.
