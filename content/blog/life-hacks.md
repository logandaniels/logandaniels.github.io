1. [Libby](https://libbyapp.com/) - ebooks from the library. It's so good! You can put a hold in on a big backlog of books, and then it's like you get a random surprise book to read each month.
2. You know the worst thing is that I started this post thinking "I only have two life hacks, but that's fine, it can be a short post." BUT I ALREADY FORGOT THE SECOND ONE!
3. [Kanopy](https://www.kanopy.com/) and [Hoopla](https://www.hoopladigital.com/) let you stream movies, also using your library card. They often have movies not available on streaming services.
4. That wasn't the second one, by the way. I'm just grasping at straws trying to salvage this post even though I lost my train of thought.
5. You don't need to scrub your dishes before you put them in the dishwasher. You can just put them in dirty and they'll still come out clean. I wasted SO much time as a teenager pre-washing dishes.
6. *That* was the second one. But I just realized I technically already mentioned the pre-wash dishes thing in [a prior blog post](blog/the-red-stuff-glows.md) so now I really feel deflated.
7. Bob's Red Mill makes [protein oats](https://www.bobsredmill.com/product/protein-oats) that are literally just oats, but have 10g of protein per serving. I don't know how this is possible.
8. Okay consider your life HACKED
