No, not the IG kind
A different follower have I in mind

These days (all days?) we tend to exalt
Leaders. And it's no great fault
It makes sense, they lead! They're what we need!
Footpaths to tread in, and advice to heed.

Who am I to question the task of leadership
To doubt this fact, I daren't ask my readership

I'd ask instead:
Who gets led?

Praise to the follower, the second in command
The yes man, the wing man, the everyman
Praise to the follower, the friend, the apostle, the fan
The blessed one, the sacred one
Who does what only a follower can

A follower commits; a follower never flakes.
What a leader gives, a follower takes.
The follower shouts, "the man has a point!"
For every king, one was there to anoint

Every duelist needs their second
Every president their veep
And yes, every shepherd
Needs a flock to fill with sheep

Let us not shame those lambs
Who indeed could join a different flock!
Or laze behind and sink the group
With bad vibes, dissent, and poop.
Yes, we are mighty, little lambs
Hail to the follower flock!
