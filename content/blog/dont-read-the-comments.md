It's fun to read the comments on articles. They're full of delicious arguments, rage bait, controversy. And there are such great opinions in the comments -- better than the article's, even! Over time, you realize it's not even worth really reading the article itself, you can just skip it and go straight to the comments...

But this is really bad. We shouldn't filter all our thoughts through the internet hive mind (remember most comments these days are algorithmically sorted, so you're not just getting a random opinion, you're getting "the agreed upon stance". And your brain will file it away as such, and implicitly feel that this is the "right" way to think, and adjust your internal opinion accordingly. It's a mimetic hazard. And it's dangerous to stop exercising our ability to read and analyze primary sources, and form opinions for ourselves. In disuse, the skill will atrophy.

So if that first paragraph describes you—if you are a commentfeeder—try completely forbidding yourself from reading comments for a while. If you're interested in an article you see, click into the article itself and give it a read. Then notice if you have an impulse "I wonder what people are saying about this" -- and if you do, *ignore it*. Instead sit with the piece and think about how *you* feel about it, figure out what *your* opinion is.

If you're in the habit of reading comments, there's a very different feeling to consuming articles this way. I think it's better. Try it!
