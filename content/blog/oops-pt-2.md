For the first time in my two 30-day blogging streaks, I completely forgot to post and went to bed. So I am writing this from the following morning. Extenuating circumstances—my mom is visiting and we went to a concert that got out late. Thankfully I am a man who excepts acceptions and accepts exceptions.

Something strange I noticed at the concert was that even though we had great seats and could see the lead singer well, he was so powerfully lit (this was in Madison Square Garden, an enormous venue) that his features all appeared washed out when I looked at him. In comparison, on the giant jumbotron televisions the video feed was properly adjusting exposure and white balance to restore to him a natural and lively skintone. So, strangely, he looked much better on the screen than he did to the naked eye. Maybe we should've gone with the cheap seats after all!
