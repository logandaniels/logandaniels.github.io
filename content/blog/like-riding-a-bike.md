It has been a while since I posted anything. I wonder if doing a *yearly* version of the "30 days of daily posting" that started this blog/website would be a good idea. Conveniently, it's November 1st, and November is (was?[^1]) famously a month for organized writing.

As I write this, I notice that some strange force in my inner psyche is rebelling strongly against writing every day this month. I don't quite know why, but I guess maybe it's wrapped up in a bundle of insecurities I've been feeling off-and-on this year.

Yet as I write this, I also notice that I obviously *should* do this, even moreso because of this reluctance. Take the medicine, Logan!

Okay, okay.

I admittedly have had various topics come up that I wanted to post about, but never got around to (or perhaps deliberately and/or subconsciously cowered from) writing. It would be nice to get those on paper before I lose touch with the inciting ideas, or burst from the unrelieved pressure.

One goal for my future writing is to get more playful. I was really pleased with ["Escape from dreamland"](blog/escape-from-dreamland.md) because the writing feels so much more fun and alive than the sterile prose I sometimes default to. Hopefully I can do more of that. Not that this post is a good example! But it's fine; I'm just greasing the gears here.

[^1]: [National Novel Writing Month](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Novel_Writing_Month) (NaNoWriMo) used to take place in November, but it was apparently canceled earlier this year -- and I mean canceled in both the "shut down" and "scandalized" sense of the word. Should budding novelists now explicitly *abstain* from writing their novel in November, in protest of the previous organization? NaNoWriMo: National NO Writing Month!
