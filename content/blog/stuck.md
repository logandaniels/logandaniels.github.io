Tonight I am stuck. I began writing too close to bedtime, I'm struggling to find a topic I feel good about, and now each I time I discard a post idea I'm trading off another 15 minutes of sleep that I'd really like to get. 

There comes a point when it's best to cut losses, and try again tomorrow. And so I shall.
