I propose an addition to the [Never Eat Alone](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/84699.Never_Eat_Alone) [^1] literary universe: Never Run Alone.

The difference between running alone and running with someone has been immense for me. Conversation makes the time go by so much more quickly. I think it's even better than listening to a podcast, because your mind is actively rather than passively engaged.

I don't know why this isn't better known; I see so many people running alone through the city, looking miserable. Probably it can be hard to find someone to run with you. But that itself is probably because many potential runners aren't willing to run, because they think they don't like running, because they've only run alone!

Yet I find myself making the same mistake with weight lifting. What marked the most enjoyable and consistent period of weight lifting in my life? Having a lifting buddy! Yet as though part of some foolish oath, I've since then only lifted in complete (and miserable) solitude.

What else is more fun with other people?
* Cooking ✅
* Studying ✅
* Chores ✅
* Taxes ✅
* Writing peer feedback for your job ✅
* ... most things?

[^1]: I have never read this book but I am assuming the thesis is that you should never eat alone.
