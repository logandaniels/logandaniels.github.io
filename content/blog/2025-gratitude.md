* Getting to move to New York this year
* Myself, my friends, and my family being in good health
* Multiple healthy happy babies born to my friends
* Having a job
* Being alive and conscious and somehow even when I go to sleep and wake up in the morning I am still me
* Being able to comfortably afford food and shelter
* Having friends who even though I left Seattle I can still be close with. And having the flexibility to be able to visit them
* Finding housing in New York that I'm really happy with, from a nice subletter, without a long drawn-out search
* My coworkers being so pleasant to work with, and so hardworking
* Going on a two-week trip to Japan with my entire family and it being a success despite constant challenges along the way
* Meeting new people in New York who have invited me to hang out again
* Getting to reconnect with old friends and coworkers who live in my new city. And I'm thankful for every single person who said yes to my invitation to meet up
* People who don't mind that like 75% of the entries so far have been about moving to New York
* Being lucky enough to have a job that meets the trifecta of work I enjoy, work I'm good at, and work the world will pay me to do
* The feeling of fresh crisp cool air after walking out of a stuffy building
* Getting to live through multiple of the greatest technological leaps in human history
* Living somewhere that I am safe from military conflict and have reliable access to shelter, healthcare, food, and fresh water
* Being able to move my body in all the ways I want
* Being able to see and to hear
* Having a support network of caring friends and family whom I can lean on if I need them
* You for reading this post
* Meeting a cat and having it like me
* Having an inexplicable and innate feeling that things will work out and be okay
* Having (at least in theory) so many more years ahead of me to keep changing, growing, and becoming better at living
* For all the mistakes I've made and lessons I've learned, that I've gotten to realize already instead of years from now
* Random positive encounters with strangers when out in public
* The feeling of crawling into a cozy bed at the end of the day
* The feeling of guzzling a cool glass of water after being very thirsty
* Free meals at the office
* Having the financial freedom to make most purchases without having to worry about how I'll be able to pay for them
* Music's ability to totally change and improve my mood from listening to a single song
* My body being able to fall and stay asleep despite all the noise outside my apartment window
* All the world-class entertainment across so many forms of art and media in the world that I get to enjoy, often for a wildly low cost
* Being on good terms with my family members
* Being ALIVE! Seriously!
