1. I value inclusion in social situations. I don't want anyone to feel left behind, forgotten, or less valued.
2. I aspire to connect people with each other. To introduce strangers, to help form friendships, to combine dissimilar groups.
3. I give generously in tips, charitable donations, and to friends or strangers in need, without seeking anything in return. I actively seek out opportunities where others need help.
4. I am keenly attuned to the emotions of others, sensing when someone is feeling "off".
5. I am curious about many things, and I seek to learn as much as I can about them, to understand how the world works, how things get done, how people got to be who they are, and how people operate.
6. I love to notice oddities in life, to point out the absurd, to create and relish in absurd situations and characters. I feast on opportunities to go against the grain.
7. I love efficiency and I seek out opportunities to improve systems and processes, to take advantage of shortcuts and hacks and unknown strategies.
8. I am tender, and cry easily in resonance with others.
9. I am physically affectionate and feel comfortable and at ease in physical contact with others.
10. I work hard at the tasks I put my mind to.
11. I aspire to live healthily, and am conscious of the nutrition of what I eat and of my level of physical activity.
12. I strive to see the best in others, to give them the benefit of the doubt. I find the positive outlook on negative outcomes in life, orienting myself toward the bright light of the sun.
13. I delight in art that moves me.
14. I am flexible and spontaneous, willing and excited to make plans on short notice.
15. I work hard to remain present, giving others my full attention and not fragmenting my focus between them and technology, media, or other people.
16. I am introspective, seeking to notice and improve upon the way that I am.
17. I aim to live as my own self, using others as inspiration and education but not as a yardstick with which to compare myself.
18. I find joy in the simple pleasures of life.
19. I embody myself authentically, avoiding donning masks or behaving insincerely. I am honest.
20. I loathe to make others feel inferior. I avoid showing off, elevating my status above them, or making moments about me when they should be about others. I strive to always be aware of how my actions and words might affect others.
21. I glow warm when I make people laugh.
