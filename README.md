Generate a production-ready build to the `_site` folder:

```
npx @11ty/eleventy
```

Or build and host on a local development server:

```
npx @11ty/eleventy --serve
```

Or you can run [debug mode](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/debugging/) to see all the internals.

## Deploy this to your own site

Deploy this Eleventy site in just a few clicks on these services:

- [Deploy this to **Netlify**](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog)
- [Deploy this to **Vercel**](https://vercel.com/import/project?template=11ty%2Feleventy-base-blog)
- Look in `.github/workflows/gh-pages.yml.sample` for information on Deploying to **GitHub Pages**.
- [Try it out on **Stackblitz**](https://stackblitz.com/github/11ty/eleventy-base-blog)
- If you run Eleventy locally you can drag your `_site` folder to [`netlify.com/drop`](https://netlify.com/drop) to upload it without using `git`.

### Implementation Notes

- `content/about/index.md` is an example of a content page.
- `content/blog/` has the blog posts but really they can live in any directory. They need only the `posts` tag to be included in the blog posts [collection](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/collections/).
- Use the `eleventyNavigation` key (via the [Eleventy Navigation plugin](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/navigation/)) in your front matter to add a template to the top level site navigation. This is in use on `content/index.njk` and `content/about/index.md`.
- Content can be in _any template format_ (blog posts needn’t exclusively be markdown, for example). Configure your project’s supported templates in `eleventy.config.js` -> `templateFormats`.
- The `public` folder in your input directory will be copied to the output folder (via `addPassthroughCopy` in the `eleventy.config.js` file). This means `./public/css/*` will live at `./_site/css/*` after your build completes.
- Provides two content feeds:
	- `content/feed/feed.njk`
	- `content/feed/json.njk`
- This project uses three [Eleventy Layouts](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/layouts/):
	- `_includes/layouts/base.njk`: the top level HTML structure
	- `_includes/layouts/home.njk`: the home page template (wrapped into `base.njk`)
	- `_includes/layouts/post.njk`: the blog post template (wrapped into `base.njk`)
- `_includes/postslist.njk` is a Nunjucks include and is a reusable component used to display a list of all the posts. `content/index.njk` has an example of how to use it.

#### Content Security Policy

If your site enforces a [Content Security Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) (as public-facing sites should), you have a few choices (pick one):

1. In `base.njk`, remove `<style>{% getBundle "css" %}</style>` and uncomment `<link rel="stylesheet" href="{% getBundleFileUrl "css" %}">`
2. Configure the server with the CSP directive `style-src: 'unsafe-inline'` (less secure).
